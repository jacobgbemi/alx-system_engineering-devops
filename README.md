# System Engineering $ Devops - Bash

This repository contains programs written for System ENgineering Devops track in the [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/) program. In these projects, I worked through virtual machine (Vagrant) using Linux terminal to learn Shell basics, permissions, I/O redirections, filters, init files, variables and expansions. I learned how to apply these knoeledge to write codes in a linux environment.

### Acknowledgement
All works in the project were completed in regard to ALX online program (Cohort 6). The program offered a peer-learning platform where the participants undergo a rigorous project-based coding exercises, and learn by interacting with one another. More info is here: [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/)
